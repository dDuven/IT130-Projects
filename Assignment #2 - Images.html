         <p>
            The first step is to plug the AC adaptor into the base that came with your Nintendo Switch. The plug is located on the back of the base.
         </p>
         
         <h2>
            Step 2
         </h2>
         
         <img src="./Assignment #2 - Images_files/Power.jpg" alt="Power adapter pluged into an outlet">
         
         <p>
            After pluging the AC adpater into the base of your Switch, the next step is to plug the other end into the nearest outlet.
         </p>
         
         <h2>
            Step 3
         </h2>
         
         <img src="./Assignment #2 - Images_files/HDMIConnected.png" alt="The HDMI connected to the base">
         
         <p>
            Next, you need to plug in the HDMI cable into the base of the Switch. The plug is located in the same area as the AC adaptor.
         </p>
         
         <h2>
            Step 4
         </h2>
         
         <img src="./Assignment #2 - Images_files/HDMI.jpg" alt="The HDMI connected to a TV/Monitor">
         
         <p>
            After plugging in your HDMI into the base of the Switch, you will have to plug the other end of the HDMI into your TV or monitor.
         </p>
         
         <h2>
            Step 5
         </h2>
         
         <img src="./Assignment #2 - Images_files/Switch.jpg" alt="The Nintendo Switch plugged into the base">
         
         <p>
            Now that everything is set up the final thing to do is to put your switch into the base. If your switch and Tv are on you should be able to see your Switch on your TV!
